# DietDiary AI
## Image processing, Android Application

An AI-powered Android application that helps users track their meals by analyzing food images and estimating nutritional values using deep learning and third-party APIs.

## ðŸ§  Overview

**DietDiaryAI** is a mobile application designed to make meal tracking effortless. Users simply take or upload photos of their meals, and the app automatically estimates the food type, portion size, and nutritional content. This is achieved through computer vision and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to promote healthier eating habits, especially for fitness-conscious individuals, students, and first-time diet trackers.
